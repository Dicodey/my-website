      <p>In the world of behavioural science, we often talk about "choice architecture". This is the way in which choices are presented to people, and it has a profound impact on what they choose.</p>
      <p>For example, placing healthy snacks at eye level in a cafeteria can significantly increase their consumption compared to placing them on a lower shelf. This is a simple "nudge" that doesn't restrict choice but guides it.</p>
      <p>In this post, we explore how digital interfaces act as choice architects every day...</p>

      <p>The average person spends over 6 hours a day looking at screens. While technology brings many benefits, it also fragments our attention and impacts our mental well-being.</p>

      <p>By curating our digital environment, we can reclaim our time and focus for what truly matters.</p>

      <p>Our brains are wired to avoid loss, making it difficult to abandon something we've invested time or money in, even when the rational thing is to walk away.</p>
      <p>In professional settings, this can lead to millions in wasted resources on "zombie projects". Learning to let go is a superpower.</p>
