      <p>In the world of behavioural science, we love a good nerdy term—and "choice architecture" is one of my favourites. It's basically the art of designing how options are presented to people, and spoiler alert: it matters <em>a lot</em>.</p>
      <p>Think about it: put the healthy snacks at eye level and suddenly everyone's reaching for carrots instead of crisps. Magic? Nope. Just a clever nudge. The beauty is, you're not taking away anyone's choice—you're just making the better option a little easier to grab.</p>
      <p>In this post, we'll explore how digital interfaces are the new cafeterias—and how they're shaping our decisions every single day, often without us even realising it...</p>

      <p>Let's be honest: we're all a little addicted to our screens. And while technology has given us a lot (cat memes, video calls with mum, instant access to any song ever made), it's also stolen something precious—our attention.</p>
      <p>Digital minimalism isn't about chucking your phone into the Thames. It's about being intentional. Which apps actually make your life better? Which ones are just... noise?</p>
      <p>By curating our digital environment—yes, like a museum of only the good stuff—we can reclaim our time and focus for the things that actually matter. Like, you know, talking to actual humans. Or just staring out the window. Remember that?</p>

      <p>We've all done it. Sat through a truly terrible film just because we'd already bought the popcorn. Or finished a book that was putting us to sleep because we were "too far in to stop now." This, my friends, is the sunk cost fallacy in action.</p>
      <p>Our brains are wired to hate losing things—even time we've already spent. So we keep investing, hoping it'll somehow pay off. Spoiler: it usually doesn't.</p>
      <p>The good news? Once you spot this sneaky mental trap, you can start to escape it. Learning to let go of what's not working—whether it's a project, a habit, or yes, a bad Netflix series—is honestly a superpower.</p>
